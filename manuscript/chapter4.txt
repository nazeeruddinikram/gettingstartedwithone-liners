# Python

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. 

It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. 

An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

######  Serve the current directory at http://localhost:8000/

This one-liner starts a web server on port 8000 with the contents of current directory on all the interfaces (address 0.0.0.0), not just localhost.

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

 If you have `"index.html"` or `"index.htm"` files, it will serve those, otherwise it will list the contents of the currently working directory.

It works because python comes with a standard module called `SimpleHTTPServer`. The `-m` argument makes python to search for a module named `SimpleHTTPServer.py` in all the possible system locations (listed in `sys.path` and `$PYTHONPATH` shell variable). Once found, it executes it as a script. If you look at the source code of this module, you'll find that this module tests if it's run as a script `if __name__ == '__main__'`, and if it is, it runs the `test()` method that makes it run a web server in the current directory.

To use a different port, specify it as the next argument:

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

This command runs a HTTP server on all local interfaces on port 8080.

######  Want to know many bytes a terabyte is? If you know further abbreviations, you can extend the list.

`import pprint;pprint.pprint(zip(('Byte', 'KByte', 'MByte', 'GByte', 'TByte'), (1 << 10*i for i in xrange(5))))`

######  Print every line from an input file but remove the first two fields.

`python -c "import sys;[sys.stdout.write(' '.join(line.split(' ')[2:])) for line in sys.stdin]" < input.txt`

######  echo unicode character

`python -c "print unichr(234)"`

This script echos "Ãª"

######  CSV file to json

`python -c "import csv,json;print json.dumps(list(csv.reader(open('csv_file.csv'))))"`
