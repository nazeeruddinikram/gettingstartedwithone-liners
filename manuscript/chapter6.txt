# sed


----

##### Show cpu load, in percent

This shows the current load of the CPU, as a percentage.

    $ sed -e 's/ .*//' -e 's/\.//' -e 's/^0*//' /proc/loadavg

Read the load from `/proc/loadavg` and convert it using the `sed` command

It's easier to break this command up into smaller chunks.

First, strip everything after the first whitespace:
`sed -e 's/ .*//'`

Next, delete the decimal point:
`-e 's/\.//'`

Finally, remove leading zeroes:
`-e 's/^0*//'`
