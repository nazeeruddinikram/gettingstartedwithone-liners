# Introduction

This little book contains all of the useful one liners that I've come across on
the web, IRC, magazines, books, email exchanges and converstations with some
amazing people I've had the very good fortune to work with over the past 20 years.

I've done my best to give credit where credit is due. See the acknowledgements
at the end of the book for details.
